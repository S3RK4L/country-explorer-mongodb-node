# Country Explorer
This project builds on the country-explorer-basic project by incorporating MongoDB and Node.js to cache API data at server startup, instead of repeated API requests on each page load. This reduces unneccessary overhead, resulting in faster response times.

I've kept the country-explorer-basic project to show project progression from not using MongoDB & Node.js, to using it. It clearly shows the difference in project structure and functionality, and allows for a side-by-side comparison on how this project improves performance and scalability.
